Patient Profile Diagnosis

The objective of this project is to find out the insights on the patient visits and the top diagnosis based on the patient diagnosis codes like CPT, ICD. 
Various factors like the patient age group, the number of times they visit and the type of diagnosis helps the doctors to understand the most common diagnosis. 
These insights can be obtained in a few seconds using a Tableau dashboard rather than spending hours viewing the data as numbers.

Key Insights:

1. Average number of visits per patient
2. Age grouping
3. Top 10 patient diagnosis by age group and sex
4. Total dignosis events per patient
5. High utilizers (who have 4+ visits)
6. Top CPT codes and their frequency
