Healthcare Claims - Where Is the Money Going?

The objective of this project is to break down healthcare spending to understand which claim types, procedures, and members drive the highest costs.
We need to analyze the healthcare claim costs based on the drivers like claim types (inpatient, outpatient, ER, pharmacy), diagnosis codes (ICD), procedure codes (CPT), billed amounts, and paid amounts.
This project dataset consists of Member and Claim details.

Key Insights:
1. Expensive Claim Types
2. Highest spending diagnosis and procedure codes
3. Highest Cost members
4. Billed Vs. Paid ratio
